# GrocerEyeYOLOv5
Based on [GrocerEye](https://github.com/bhimar/GrocerEye), trained and infered on YOLOv5

# Dataset
The dataset it's from GrocerEye's repository, **all credits to it**!
The structure was modified to met the charateristics of yolov5

# Dependencies
Here is used YOLOv5 6.2 which works better with Python 3.7

The notebook can be run on Kaggle or Colab without a problem.

# Why doing this?
I need to use a groceries detector in [CodeProject AI](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5322557/CodeProject-AI-Server-AI-the-easy-way) and the weights in original GrocerEye's repository was not working well to load and try to export to an .pt file.

So, I decided to train and export my own YOLO model using the dataset. That's why this repo exists.
